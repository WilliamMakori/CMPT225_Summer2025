## 🧠 Course Overview
CMPT 225 is one of the core computer science courses at SFU, emphasizing how to write efficient, maintainable, and well-structured software. The course covers:

- Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
- Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists  
- Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and AVL Trees  
- Hash Tables and Hash Functions  
- Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort)  
- Graphs and Traversal Algorithms (BFS, DFS)  
- Time and Space Complexity Analysis (Big-O)  
- Object-Oriented Programming Principles in C++

---

## ⚙️ Technologies and Tools
- **Language:** C++  
- **Build System:** Makefile  
- **IDE / Editor:** VS Code, Xcode  
- **Version Control:** Git / GitHub  

All assignments and projects were designed and implemented from scratch, focusing on both **analytical** and **experimental** performance evaluation.

## 💡 What I Learned
From CMPT 225, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Designing and implementing **data structures from first principles**
- Applying **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and **modular design**
- Performing **runtime analysis** and empirical testing
- Writing **clean, well-documented C++ code**
- Using **Git for version control and collaboration**

This coursework forms the foundation for more advanced topics I’m now studying — including **Computer Systems (CMPT 295)**, **Computability and Complexity (CMPT 308)**, and **Visual Computing (CMPT 361)**.
